A Whale off the Port(Folio) - Anaylsis and answers to assignment questions

-This script will evaluate performance and risk amongst various algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios and compare them against the S&P 500 Index.

-Based on the calculations and plots of Daily Returns and Cumulative Returns, it appears that Algo 2 outperforms the S&P 500.

-Given that the highest values in my standard deviation calculations are for Tiger Global Management LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc, it appears these portfolios are riskier than the S&P500.

-Looking at the correlation calculations, it appears that Paulson & Co. Inc. is the closest to mimicking the S&P 500.
-Finally, looking at the Sharpe Ratio calculations and bar plots illustrates that the Algorithmic portfolio does in fact outperform the Whale portfolio and the S&P 500 Index.


Rena's Custom Stock Portfolio (GOOG, FB, TSLA)

-The chosen stocks for my portfolio include GOOG, FB and TSLA for the period of Jan 1 2019 to Jan 1 2020.

-Looking at the risk analysis for each portfolio against the S&P 60 TSX, TSLA has the highest volatility.

-Looking at the correlation calculations, it appears that GOOG most closely mimics the S&P 60 TSX.

-Looking at the rolling beta calculations, it appears that FB and TSLA are generally more volatile than the market.

-Finally, looking at the Sharpe Ratio calculations illustrates that FB has a greater return-to-risk ratio than GOOG and TSLA. However, my portfolio does not quite outperform the S&P 60 TSX.
