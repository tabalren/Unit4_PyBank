UNIT 4 Homework Assignment: A Whale Off the Portfolio
-------------------------------------------------------
-This script will evaluate performance and risk amongst various algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios and compare them against the S&P 500 Index.
-Based on the calculations and plots of Daily Returns and Cumulative Returns, it appears that Algo 2 outperforms the S&P 500.
-Given that the highest values in my standard deviation calculations are for Tiger Global Management LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc, it appears these portfolios are riskier than the S&P500.
-Looking at the correlation calculations, it appears that Paulson & Co. Inc. is the closest to mimicking the S&P 500.
-Finally, looking at the Sharpe Ratio calculations and bar plots illustrates that the Algorithmic portfolio does in fact outperform the Whale portfolio and the S&P 500 Index.
