Rena's Custom Stock Portfolio Analysis
---------------------------------------
-The chosen stocks for my portfolio include GOOG, FB and TSLA for the period of Jan 1 2019 to Jan 1 2020.
-Looking at the risk analysis for each portfolio against the S&P 60 TSX, TSLA has the highest volatility.
-Looking at the correlation calculations, it appears that GOOG most closely mimics the S&P 60 TSX.
-Looking at the rolling beta calculations, it appears that FB and TSLA are generally more volatile than the market.
-Finally, looking at the Sharpe Ratio calculations illustrates that FB has a greater return-to-risk ratio than GOOG and TSLA. However, my portfolio does not quite outperform the S&P 60 TSX.
